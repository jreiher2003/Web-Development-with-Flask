### Purpose of project  

---

The purpose of this project is to practice Udacity's Acsii Chan project with Flask's framework instead of webapp2.  I plan on making *two* versions.


#### First Version  (master)
flask development web server and sqlalchemy with bootstrap.  This version is just for development and practice using the 3 tech sources.  


#### Second Version  (GAE)
GAE dev_appserver google datastore and GQL syntex.  I chose this because its free and I can have practice with deployment without cost.
